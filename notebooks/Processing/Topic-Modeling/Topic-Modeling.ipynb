Aggregate losses<br>reported in 2014 for both Global (Non-U.S.) P&C and Global<br>Specialty sub-segments were below the Company’s expectations<br>for most prior underwriting years.",
          "For accident years 1999 through 2002, we experienced higher<br>than expected claims trends in Missouri.",
          "The 2011 accident year loss and LAE ratio includes 1.2<br>percentage points of higher than an expected or ‘normal<br>level’ of storm loss activity.",
          "Recent experience has been slightly adverse to expectations<br>and the Group has noted decisions of the FCJ in 2014 and<br>2015 involving German insurers in relation to a German<br>industry-wide issue regarding notification of contractual<br>‘cooling off’ periods.",
          "The negative insurance volatility during 2014 of £219<br>million primarily reflects an adverse performance on equity<br>and cash investments in the period relative to expected<br>return.",
          "Divestments and reorganisations due to decreased business<br>volume resulted in a higher number of employees leaving the<br>Company than originally forecasted.",
          "In addition, during the first quarter of 2008, we revised<br>our earnings guidance for 2008 primarily related to higher<br>than anticipated medical costs, lower than expected fully-<br>insured enrollment and the changing economic environment.",
          "During 2003, both paid and incurred losses and LAE emerged<br>at amounts that were greater than anticipated when reserves<br>for loss and LAE were estimated and recorded at December 31,<br>2002 for the workers' compensation and general liability<br>lines of business.",
          "This figure is equivalent to 5.5% (0.9%) of net earned<br>premiums, and below the level to be expected. With a cost to<br>Munich Re of €404m, strong forest fires in the Canadian<br>province of Alberta in May 2016 were by far the biggest loss<br>of the year.",
          "In 2000, the Company increased its reserves for prior years<br>by $1,428,000, primarily due to higher than anticipated<br>frequency and severity of losses related to personal<br>automobile, commercial automobile and workers' compensation<br>policies.",
          "Both segments experienced increases in their loss and<br>settlement expense ratios during 2014, but the increase was<br>especially large in the reinsurance segment due to increases<br>in both loss severity and catastrophe and storm losses, and<br>the unusually low loss and settlement expense ratio reported<br>for 2013.",
          "In the Business Insurance and Financial, Professional &<br>International Insurance segments, the Company experienced a<br>higher than anticipated level of large, non weather-related<br>losses during 2008. In the Personal Insurance segment, the<br>Company experienced a higher than anticipated level of non-<br>catastrophe weather related losses during 2008.",
          "The increase is the result of increased accounts receivable<br>due to the Chronimed merger and a $7.1 million fourth<br>quarter charge to reflect an increase in the allowance for<br>doubtful accounts receivable created by lower than expected<br>collections during the Chronimed merger integration period.",
          "During 2012, this class recognized $68 million of adverse<br>prior year loss reserve development due to several large<br>claims that involved unusual coverage issues for this class.",
          "This re-estimation was due to changes in the selected<br>development patterns on the 2000 and 1999 accident years, as<br>the number of claims and claim severity exceeded our<br>expectations.",
          "The decrease in earnings was driven by lower membership in<br>all products resulting in an expected 41% decrease in member<br>months for the full year 2011 compared to 2010 and a<br>resulting increase in our administrative expense ratio (the<br>ratio of commissions and general and administrative expenses<br>to net premiums) from 12.4% in 2010 to 15.5% in 2011. This<br>decrease was partially offset by the medical benefit ratio<br>improving to 82.3% for the full year 2011 compared to 83.6%<br>for 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, there was<br>$18.1 million of net favorable prior year development<br>compared to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31,<br>2010.",

          "The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helvetia Group,<br>Erich Walser, died unexpectedly on 30 December 2014. Erich<br>Walser played a decisive role, first as CEO, and later as<br>Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors,<br>Executive Management and employees were deeply affected by<br>his sudden death. Erich Walser was 67 years old when he<br>died, following a brief, serious illness in the middle of<br>his active, dedicated and successful career with Helvetia.",
          "Numerous actuarial assumptions on assumed casualty<br>reinsurance turned out to be low, including loss cost<br>trends, particularly on excess of loss business, and the<br>impact of deteriorating terms and conditions. Workers’<br>compensation reserves also deteriorated, as medical<br>inflation trends were above initial expectations.",
          "As discussed below, losses from the GPPO product were<br>principally driven by higher than expected claims frequency.",
          "During 2016, we sold $790.2 million of fixed maturity<br>investments which resulted in gross investment losses<br>(before income taxes) of $95.2 million. Securities are<br>generally sold at a loss following unforeseen issue-specific<br>events or conditions or shifts in perceived risks.",
          "The primary reason for the redundancies in this area is that<br>claim severity developed better than we anticipated, coupled<br>with significant redundancies from CAR, which approximated<br>27% of the total automobile liability redundancy.",
          "We experienced unfavorable development of about $70 million<br>in the fidelity class due to higher than expected reported<br>loss emergence, related to the 2010 accident year and, to a<br>lesser extent, the 2009 accident year.",
          "Despite continued intensive efforts on the part of our<br>nearly 180,000 employees as well as our agents and<br>cooperation partners, all of whom have earned my sincere<br>thanks for their unremitting efforts, our net income<br>amounted to only 1.6 billion euros – a solid billion euros<br>less than planned.",

          "Market background (unaudited) Overall, 2008 has been<br>characterised by rapid dislocation in financial markets. In<br>many cases, the dramatic liquidity squeeze and rise in<br>funding costs for financial institutions has resulted in<br>reluctance or inability of market participants to transact,<br>and has adversely affected the performance of most financial<br>institutions globally, including the Group. Stock markets<br>have experienced extraordinary falls, and levels of<br>volatility have been at record highs. Commodity prices have<br>reduced sharply in the second half of the year, and credit<br>spreads continued to widen. Market perception of<br>counterparty risk increased and the failure of major credit<br>protection providers caused fair value losses for the Group<br>and other market participants and further increased the<br>costs of mitigating credit exposure.",

At the end of 2012, economic momentum in the<br>overall Eurozone reached its interim low point. In light of<br>the weak economy, the inflation rate, averaging 2.5 per<br>cent, was also unusually high.",
          "During 2008, the capital and credit markets experienced<br>extreme volatility and disruption. Since September 2008, the<br>volatility and disruptions intensified significantly with a<br>severity and speed that was not anticipated. This was driven<br>by, among other things, heightened concerns over conditions<br>in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets, the availability<br>and cost of credit, the health of U.S. and global financial<br>institutions, a decline in business and consumer confidence<br>and increased unemployment.",

As the market lost confidence in<br>countries with particularly high government debt or deficit<br>levels through 2011 and the first half of 2012, a further<br>feedback loop developed between rising sovereign bond yields<br>and a deteriorating outlook for government finances, raising<br>the prospect of Eurozone break-up.",

In certain cases, governments nationalised<br>companies or parts thereof. The measures adopted in the<br>Netherlands included emergency funding and capital<br>reinforcement, and a Dutch Credit Guarantee Scheme, both of<br>which have expired.

Real gross domestic<br>product was up just 1.9 per cent, following 2.8 per cent in<br>the previous year. This was primarily due, not only to<br>noticeable tax increases at the beginning of the year, which<br>weighed on private consumer spending, but also to further<br>cutbacks in government spending. These factors, as well as<br>the prolonged debate over the budget and debt ceiling –<br>which culminated in a two-week government shutdown in<br>October – contributed to a considerable level of uncertainty<br>among consumers and companies.",

          "The larger than usual impairment charge in the third quarter<br>of 2002 was due primarily to recognition that certain agents<br>experienced sustained premium revenue trends that were<br>significantly different from prior estimates, resulting in<br>changes in estimated future cash flows for those agents.",
          "This impairment was a result of declining sales, which led<br>to lower than planned net income at the reporting unit<br>level.",
          "Utilization also continues to be higher than expected. The<br>Company determined that goodwill and intangibles were no<br>longer recoverable and recorded an impairment charge in<br>light of the historical and increasing losses in the market<br>and expected future cash flows.",
          "Also during 2015, we experienced higher than anticipated<br>opt-out rates and member attrition in the new Michigan dual<br>demonstration program, resulting in lower than expected<br>membership and lower blended premium rates. As a result, the<br>fair value of estimated contingent consideration was reduced<br>from $50 million to $16 million, and we recorded a gain of<br>$34 million in general and administrative expenses. In<br>connection with the lower membership and revenue outlook, we<br>conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable<br>intangible assets and goodwill, resulting in a reduction of<br>goodwill and intangible assets of $38 million which was<br>recorded in general and administrative expenses.",
          "In addition, software was identified, which was not utilized<br>as originally expected, resulting in USD 30 million of<br>impairments.",
          "Furthermore, apart from recording planned depreciation of<br>€99m on our investment property, we had to recognise<br>unscheduled portfolio impairments of €75m.",

          "This impairment was a result of declining sales,<br>particularly in the fourth quarter of 2004, which led to<br>lower than planned net income at the reporting unit level.",
          "Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company incurred an<br>impairment loss of $388 in 2016 resulting from the write-<br>down of lease intangibles and other assets associated with<br>the unexpected closure of one tenant’s business at this<br>property.",
          "Our strategic decisions made in the second quarter of 2017,<br>combined with the decrease in projected volumes based on<br>current market trends, resulted in a significant reduction<br>in expected future net cash flows for the Services business<br>compared to our previous projections.",

          "The decline in revenues was due primarily to lower sales of<br>power generators at Campbell Hausfeld and lower unit sales<br>at Kirby. In 1999, sales of generators were unusually high<br>due in part to Year 2000 concerns. In addition to the impact<br>on operating profits from the aforementioned revenue<br>declines, the decline in operating profits was also due in<br>part to reduced profits at World Book.",
          "During the second quarter of 2017, the Services segment<br>performed below forecasted levels. The anticipated business<br>and growth opportunities for certain business lines in our<br>Services segment had been impacted by: (i) market demand,<br>which was lower than anticipated; (ii) increased<br>competition, including with respect to product alternatives<br>and pricing; and (iii) delays in the realization of<br>efficiencies and margin improvements associated with certain<br>technology initiatives.",

As a result, the<br>fair value of estimated contingent consideration was reduced<br>from $50 million to $16 million, and we recorded a gain of<br>$34 million in SG&A. In connection with the lower membership<br>and revenue outlook, we conducted an impairment analysis of<br>the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, resulting<br>in a reduction of goodwill and intangible assets of $38<br>million which was recorded in SG&A.",

As a result of<br>tightening our credit criteria the quality of new business<br>written over the last two years has improved.

          "For the reinsurance industry the 2011 financial year was<br>most notable for extraordinarily heavy strains from natural<br>disasters.",
          "It is also due to the exceptional number of natural<br>catastrophes that occurred last year: none of them caused<br>spectacular losses, but together they gave rise to costs of<br>over €1.1bn, or €700m more than in the previous year.",
          "The 2011 net loss was driven by the magnitude of record<br>level of catastrophe storm losses we experienced in the<br>second quarter of 2011, which significantly exceeded our<br>projections.",
          "The 2011 results include losses of $5.9 million after-tax,<br>due to higher than expected or ‘normal level’ of storm<br>activity in 2011.",
          "Although claims from natural catastrophes remained at a<br>relatively low level in 2001, large property losses arising<br>from man-made events as well as liability and surety losses<br>were exceptionally high, particularly in the second half of<br>the year.",
          "Although this unusual accumulation of severe catastrophes<br>meant that our original profit guidance for 2017 was no<br>longer attainable, we were well positioned to absorb even<br>such heavy losses.",
          "Due to an unprecedented amount of significant catastrophic<br>losses coupled with significant net investment losses, the<br>Company experienced net loss for 2011 of $28.2 million<br>compared to net income of $25.0 million for 2010.",

          "2010 was a difficult year for catastrophe business around<br>the world; in the first place, a large number of catastrophe<br>losses were recorded, and secondly, the forecast rate<br>reductions for the most part materialised.",
          "Our underwriting result was distinctly worse than in the<br>previous year, owing to the unusually high number of natural<br>catastrophes.",

          "We experienced a significant level of catastrophe losses in<br>2020, driven by industry-wide U.S. catastrophe loss activity<br>that significantly exceeded the 5- and 10-year historical<br>means of approximately 4 points.",
          "In Japan we suffered a loss running into high single-digit<br>millions of euros under a sizeable risk-oriented treaty due<br>to an unusual accumulation of suicides and accidents<br>resulting in death.",
          "In Japan, property-casualty business was affected by<br>exceptionally high losses from natural catastrophes<br>(particularly typhoons) in summer and autumn 2004.",
          "Consistent with our business model, the Company experienced<br>modest losses from the 2010 or 2011 global catastrophe<br>events; however, the unusually high frequency of loss<br>activity from U.S. thunderstorm and tornado did impact our<br>U.S clients in the second quarter of 2011, adversely<br>affecting the Company's results.",
          "The German non-life market experienced unusually high claims<br>in 2011.",
          "What was unusual about this current period of above-average<br>catastrophe and storm losses was the fact that the Company<br>had experienced record levels of catastrophe and storm<br>losses in two of the four years.",

          "__ The losses of 11th September posed a particularly big<br>challenge to Munich Re’s claims management. It was necessary<br>to quantify claims of unprecedented size and complexity as<br>quickly as possible in nearly all classes of business, to<br>organize the handling of these claims in terms of personnel,<br>and to ensure that our clients’ payment requests were dealt<br>with swiftly and responsibly.",
          "In the second quarter of 2002, the segment increased its<br>estimated loss reserves for the September 11 event by $127<br>million due primarily to higher than originally estimated<br>business interruption losses and exposure to potential<br>claims by the Lloyd’s Central Guaranty Fund.",
          "The destruction and devastation of those events have<br>resulted in the largest insurance loss in America's history<br>and have reshaped the insurance marketplace more rapidly<br>than expected. Along with this historic loss, larger than<br>anticipated loss experience across all risks, stock market<br>declines, lower interest rates and diminished risk capacity<br>have led to unprecedented short-term premium rate increases.",
          "They were triggered by the losses resulting from the<br>terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, with<br>corresponding implications for the reinsurance of exposures<br>in property business. The surprising scale of the need for<br>additional reserves in almost all areas of liability<br>business was also of great concern to reinsurers. What is<br>more, there was another rise in the number of liability<br>claims relating to asbestos-related illnesses.",
          "The impact of the total destruction of the WTC on the other<br>nearby buildings went beyond historical experience. The<br>collapse of the WTC created huge amounts of debris which<br>affected many surrounding buildings, resulting in property<br>damage ranging from small losses to complete destruction.<br>This additional impact on the surrounding area will now need<br>to be anticipated in underwriting.",
          "Due to the economic downturn and the losses from claims<br>relating to the attacks on the World Trade Center, ING<br>recorded an increase of 5.3% in operational net profit per<br>share, which is considerably below the target.",
          "The after tax loss in 1994 of $6,830,000 was related<br>primarily to an increase in prior years reserves relating to<br>an unexpected decision in 1994 by a U.S. federal court<br>concerning the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie air disaster.",
          "The terrorist attack of 11th September gave rise to<br>extremely high losses in the business year 2001, deeply<br>impacting Munich Re’s results. However, thanks to its solid<br>financial foundations, the company was able to close with a<br>positive result for the year and even to consolidate and<br>extend its position in the insurance and reinsurance<br>markets.",
          "Revenues and earnings were lower than expected due to weak<br>economies and the World Trade Center attacks.",
          "The terrorist attack in the U.S. had a substantial effect<br>upon our earnings performance in the year 2001. The attack<br>not only resulted in the loss of thousands of lives but also<br>destroyed insured property of unprecedented magnitude.",
          "In 2001, Aon recorded pretax unusual charges of $158<br>million, net of insurance and reinsurance reimbursements,<br>related to losses sustained as a result of the destruction<br>of the World Trade Center and the death of 175 employees.",
          "As a result, 2002 accident year results for property lines<br>were better than normally expected. Underwriting results for<br>2001 included approximately $1.54 billion of net losses from<br>the September 11th terrorist attack, as well as $87 million<br>of losses from other catastrophes (principally Tropical<br>Storm Allison) and other large individual property losses.",
          "After tax recoveries relating specifically to this unusual<br>loss event, the net loss from the September 11 attacks<br>totaled $75.0 million.",
          "The September 11 attacks resulted in approximately USD 535<br>million claims loss, primarily through ING Re, the<br>reinsurance operation, which had an unusual concentration of<br>reinsurance risk in the upper floors of the World Trade<br>Center towers.",
          "Due principally to the complexity of the claims and inherent<br>lag in reporting from insureds and cedents, management<br>believed it was necessary to increase the estimate for<br>ultimate losses. During 2003, the Company reduced loss<br>reserves by $197.2 million related to the reinsurance<br>segment, primarily aviation lines, due to higher than<br>expected levels of participation (97%) in the September 11<br>Victims Compensation Fund. During 2004, the Company<br>increased reserves by $18.7 million primarily as a result of<br>an increase in accident and health claims related to the<br>September 11 event.",
          "MARKET AND COMPETITION In the worldwide reinsurance market<br>in 2002, operating conditions were increasingly competitive<br>as a result of (i) the exceptional claims experience in 2001<br>resulting from the U.S. terrorist attacks on September 11,<br>2001 and (ii) the continued deterioration in world financial<br>markets. As a result, many competitors took action in order<br>to increase profitability and solvency by increasing<br>premiums, increasing the amount of the deductible paid by<br>the cedant, and tightening of underwriting policies.",
          "The increase in estimate for the September 11 event of $127<br>million related primarily to higher than originally<br>estimated business interruption losses and exposure to<br>potential claims by the Lloyd’s Central Guaranty Fund.",
          "Subsequent to 2001, our net loss resulting from the<br>terrorist attacks decreased to $11.2 million. This reduction<br>($3.0 million and $1.9 million in 2003 and 2002,<br>respectively) is the result of reported claims from this<br>event being lower than originally projected.",
          "INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE The global reinsurance and large-<br>risk corporate property & casualty market place has been<br>significantly affected by exceptional major losses in 2001,<br>in particular from the U.S. terrorist attacks on September<br>11, 2001.",
          "The loss in 1994 was primarily due to adverse loss<br>development on recent accident years accompanied with a bulk<br>reserve strengthening of $75 million relating to higher than<br>expected case emergence.",
          "The terrorist attack of 11 September 2001 gave rise to a<br>previously inconceivable loss.",
          "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Unusual Loss Events in 2001.",
          "The largest-ever loss event up to that point had been<br>Hurricane Andrew in 1992 resulting in insured losses<br>\"merely\" half of those of the 11 September event. The scale<br>of the loss suffered by the insurance sector in the 2001<br>financial year becomes thus clearer. Yet at the same time<br>the ability of the insurance and reinsurance industry to<br>shoulder such a once-in-a-hundred-years burden has also been<br>clearly demonstrated. The events of 11 September also bore<br>out the exceptional role of reinsurance as an instrument of<br>security for national economies and highlighted the<br>importance of its risk minimisation function for primary<br>insurers.",
          "Owing to the 11th September atrocities, 2001 was the travel<br>industry’s most difficult year for decades. Bookings for<br>business trips and holidays fell by as much as 30% in the<br>fourth quarter. After pleasing growth of 16.3% in net<br>premiums in the first nine months of 2001 compared with the<br>same period in the previous year, growth for the year as a<br>whole totalled 7.9% (1.0%).",
          "An unprecedented number of claims – from the tragic losses<br>of Malaysian Airlines flights MH17 and MH370 and AirAsia<br>flight QZ8501, to the damage and destruction of 18 aircraft<br>at Libya’s Tripoli airport – kept the aviation market in the<br>headlines over the year, with industry losses exceeding $1<br>billion.",
          "During 2001, the U.S. operations segment was negatively<br>impacted by the events of September 11th and higher than<br>expected claims in its traditional business.",
          "In 2001, Aon recorded pretax unusual charges of $158 million<br>($97 million after-tax or $0.35 per dilutive share), net of<br>insurance and reinsurance recoveries, related to losses<br>sustained as a result of the destruction of the World Trade<br>Center on September 11, 2001 and the death of 175 employees.",
          "After the almost apocalyptic events in New York in September<br>2001, which led to one of the worst underwriting results in<br>Munich Re’s history, a harder year seemed barely<br>conceivable.",
          "Earnings during 2001 were adversely affected by the<br>terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, investment losses<br>on sales and impairments of investment securities, the<br>accrual of additional reserves to support the Company's<br>reinsurance of Argentine pension business, and higher than<br>expected mortality results in the U.S. operations.",
          "A new dimension in destructive terrorism not only took the<br>lives of thousands of human beings and inflicted tremendous<br>pain and suffering on colleagues, friends and relatives of<br>the victims; the attack also resulted in insurance losses of<br>unprecedented magnitude and dealt the world’s financial<br>markets a severe blow.",
          "World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001. It<br>caused the situation to change dramatically for the<br>reinsurers and reinforced the hardening process of the<br>reinsurance market which was already increasing before the<br>attacks and reached afterwards a level never seen in the<br>past. The year 2002 burdened the non-life insurers globally<br>with about USD 13.5 billion related to natural disasters and<br>man-made damages.",
          "The 2002 financial year was as difficult as it was<br>successful for your company. As you are aware, the burden<br>resulting from the terrible terrorist attacks of 11<br>September 2001 in New York and Washington was considerable.<br>Indeed, it was only thanks to our strategy of<br>diversification that we were one of the few reinsurers in<br>the world to close 2001 without posting a loss. I am all the<br>more pleased to report that in 2002 we were able to fully<br>resume our successful course and even surpass the results of<br>recent years.",
          "The underwriting results in 2001 reflect an exceptionally<br>large loss from the September 11th terrorist attack and<br>charges from revisions to inadequate loss reserve estimates<br>established for pre-2001 claims primarily driven by higher<br>than expected levels of reported claims.",
          "This amounted to $8.3 million, or 7.1% of the overall loss<br>ratio, and related to the events occurring on September 11,<br>2001. Specifically, the loss reserves relating to the<br>terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 on the Pentagon and<br>the hijacked airliner that crashed in Pennsylvania were<br>reduced as a result of lower than expected losses.",
          "In the second quarter 2002, the Company increased its<br>estimated loss reserves for the September 11 event by $127<br>million due primarily to higher than originally estimated<br>business interruption losses and exposure to potential<br>claims by the Lloyd’s Central Guaranty Fund.",
          "Income was down in 2001 due primarily to higher realized net<br>investment losses, and higher than expected claims, arising<br>primarily from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.",

          "Although our earnings were lower than expected because of<br>the unforeseen terrorist attack, we propose to distribute a<br>dividend of 1.50 euros per share to our shareholders for the<br>year 2001.",
          "The strong degradation of the reinsurance ceded in 2002 is<br>explained by the exceptional cost of the September 11th<br>attacks, for which the gross charge in 2001 was partly<br>reinsured.",
          "Our reinsurance result was shaped by three factors which are<br>typical of our business but which have rarely accumulated so<br>massively: – The risk of change had a dramatic impact on<br>insurers and reinsurers in the year under review. A<br>terrorist attack with such catastrophic consequences for<br>many classes of insurance simultaneously was inconceivable<br>prior to 11th September. And where policyholders, insurers<br>and reinsurers do not perceive a risk, it follows that this<br>cannot be reflected in prices and conditions. Our logical<br>conclusion has been to adopt a new model for classifying and<br>evaluating terrorism risks, which we have been implementing<br>since October.",
          "Underwriting results for 2001 include approximately $1.54<br>billion of net losses from the September 11th terrorist<br>attack. While the potential impact of catastrophes and other<br>large individual property losses is normally factored into<br>reinsurance prices, past pricing did not consider the<br>unprecedented magnitude of possible losses arising from the<br>terrorist acts. The severity of the losses arising from the<br>September 11th attack underscored that risks of this kind<br>were not contemplated in premium rates. Lines of business<br>that previously were expected to have little correlation<br>were adversely affected in the same event to an unforeseen<br>degree. Claims arising from other catastrophes and large<br>individual property losses ($20 million or greater) in 2001,<br>2000 and 1999 periods were $87 million, $53 million and $202<br>million, respectively.",
          "Specifically, the loss reserves relating to the terrorist<br>attacks of September 11, 2001 on the Pentagon and the<br>hijacked airliner that crashed in Pennsylvania were reduced<br>as a result of lower than expected losses. Offsetting this<br>benefit were net catastrophe losses in the ocean marine line<br>in 2004 arising from Hurricane Ivan that increased losses<br>incurred by $2.8 million and reduced net premiums earned by<br>$1.6 million due to reinsurance reinstatement costs.",
          "It was the first time that a global economic recession,<br>financial market depreciation, and a series of severe losses<br>– in particular those related to the tragic terrorist<br>attacks on the US – occurred simultaneously. These were all<br>external events over which the AXA Group had no control<br>whatsoever. Our situation was analogous to that of a ship<br>caught in the eye of a storm.",
          "Loss experience in this segment is based significantly on<br>actuarial estimates, as actual losses are still in their<br>early stages of development. In 2001, the unprecedented<br>September 11, 2001, terrorist attack materially impacted the<br>results in this segment. The Company identified losses of<br>$19.6 million, net of reinsurance benefit as of December 31,<br>2001, and a further $15.4 million in losses has been<br>recorded in 2002.",
          "With the exception of Enron, whose deterioration was much<br>more precipitous and unexpected, the Company had been<br>concerned about these securities prior to the end of 2001.<br>However, the events of September 11th and the resulting<br>economic recession eventually caused their outlook to become<br>overwhelmingly negative and the securities were adjusted<br>down to the quoted market values in 2001.",
          "In the US, American Re experienced its most difficult year<br>to date. This was mainly due to the following circumstances:<br>As one of the leading reinsurers in the US non-life market,<br>American Re had to cope with extremely high claims costs of<br>€1.2bn gross from the atrocity of 11th September. Besides<br>this, provisions for losses from previous years had to be<br>substantially strengthened again.",
          "In 2001, Aon recorded pretax unusual charges of $158 million<br>($97 million after-tax or $0.35 per dilutive share), net of<br>insurance and reinsurance recoveries, related to losses<br>sustained as a result of the destruction of the World Trade<br>Center on September 11, 2001 and the death of 175 employees.",
          "After tax recoveries relating specifically to this unusual<br>loss event, the net loss from the September 11 attacks<br>totaled $75.0 million.",
          "• Excluding the exceptional impact of the U.S. terrorist<br>attacks claim, the all accident year loss ratio net of<br>reinsurance deteriorated by 1.3 point, mainly due to<br>unfavorable reserve developments in professional liability,<br>marine and assumed business.",
          "The insurance industry was hit extremely hard by this event<br>in two respects: Not only was there the unprecedented extent<br>of material damage caused by a terrorist attack across all<br>classes of insurance, but the industry was also painfully<br>confronted with the far-reaching influence of this loss<br>event on the development of the global economy, including<br>stock prices.",
          "Approximately $300 million of reserves related to the<br>terrorist attack remained as of December 31, 2002. Although<br>a very large underwriting gain was achieved in 2002 as a<br>result of unusually low catastrophe occurrences, a single<br>loss event could have easily eliminated those gains.",
          "During the second quarter 2002, the Company increased loss<br>reserves by $200.0 million in both the insurance and<br>reinsurance segments following the receipt of updated loss<br>information. In the fourth quarter 2003, the Company<br>released loss reserves related to the reinsurance segment,<br>primarily aviation lines, due to the higher than expected<br>levels of participation (97%) in the September 11 Victims<br>Compensation Fund, a no-fault compensation scheme funded by<br>the U.S. government, which closed on December 22, 2003.",
          "reported as an Unusual credit-World Trade Center in the<br>consolidated statements of income. Aon continues to present<br>additional claims to insurers for losses related to extra<br>expenses, leasehold interests and business interruption<br>coverage, and we expect additional recoveries and gains when<br>specific claims are settled.",
          "Hopes of a recovery in late summer were ultimately dashed by<br>the terrorist attacks of 11 September. Forecasts of economic<br>growth had to be revised sharply downwards over the year.",
          "Market During 2001, several factors have impacted the Life &<br>Savings markets in which AXA operates, in particular, the<br>U.S. terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. At the time of<br>these events, the global economy was already showing signs<br>of an economic slowdown, which was adversely affecting the<br>stock markets. However, the terrorist attacks and the<br>resulting aftermath had an unprecedented effect on the<br>global financial markets.",
          "Terrorism on a new scale The terrorist attacks on the World<br>Trade Center on 11 September 2001 gave rise to the heaviest<br>insurance losses in history, with the Lloyd’s market alone<br>paying out more than $1.98 bn. The security of Lloyd’s held<br>but the shock prompted a review of the market’s governance.<br>Andrew Beazley was a member of the Chairman’s Strategy Group<br>at Lloyd’s, which set down a blueprint for reforms including<br>the creation of the Franchise Board in 2003. With the<br>oversight of the Franchise Board, Lloyd’s has enjoyed a<br>period of exceptional growth and stability.",
          "In the fourth quarter 2003, the Company reduced aviation<br>loss reserves related to the September 11 event by $197.0<br>million. This reduction was due to higher than expected<br>levels of participation (97%) in the State Victim<br>Compensation Fund, a no-fault compensation scheme funded by<br>the U.S. government which closed on December 22, 2003. This<br>resulted in a reduction in the estimated ultimate losses by<br>the Company for this event.",
          "An example of an unanticipated event is the September 11<br>attacks. The Company’s loss from those attacks, after<br>reinsurance and taxes, was $75 million.",
          "In the first three quarters of 2001 it looked as if we were<br>on course to improve the underwriting result compared with<br>the previous year, but hopes of this were dashed by the<br>heavy claims burden from the WTC catastrophe and other large<br>losses.",
          "As a result of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade<br>Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. on<br>11 September 2001, aviation insurance suffered losses on a<br>hitherto unprecedented scale.",

          "Catastrophe losses were $13.2 million, or 7.2 points, in<br>2006 compared to $2.8 million, or 1.7 points, in 2005, and<br>$13.3 million, or 8.7 points, in 2004. In addition, large<br>property losses in 2005 were unusually low compared to the<br>more normalized trend we are experiencing this year.",
          "Aviation - The hurricanes increased the loss ratio 6.5% for<br>2004. Otherwise, underwriting results have generally been<br>better in 2004 than in 2003. The low loss ratio in 2002 was<br>due to unusually good loss experience in that year.",
          "These large catastrophe losses contributed 10.0% to the<br>segment loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004.<br>Catastrophe losses were partially offset by lower than<br>expected incurred loss development in the year relating to<br>shorter tail lines prior underwriting years and price<br>improvements on earned premiums from prior periods.",
          "Underwriting results were exceptionally profitable in 2006<br>compared with highly profitable results in 2005 and 2004.<br>Our combined loss and expense ratio was 84.2% in 2006<br>compared with 92.3% in both 2005 and 2004. The impact of<br>catastrophes accounted for 1.4 percentage points of the<br>combined ratio in 2006 compared with 5.6 percentage points<br>in 2005 and 2.3 percentage points in 2004. The greater<br>catastrophe impact in 2005 was due to costs of $462 million<br>related to Hurricane Katrina, including estimated net losses<br>of $403 million and net reinsurance reinstatement premium<br>costs of $59 million.",
          "During the early stages of development, insurance revenues<br>and investment income were not sufficient to absorb our<br>operating expenses and operating losses resulted. Further,<br>the benefits of tax losses generated would not be recognized<br>until our operating results produced sufficient taxable<br>income. In addition, due to the lower than expected premium<br>volume in 2005, our expense levels were disproportionate to<br>our earned premium.",
          "Catastrophe losses increased $28.1 million, to $59.4 million<br>for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $31.3<br>million for the same period in 2002. Catastrophe losses in<br>2002 were unusually low. Additionally, segment income for<br>the year ended December 31, 2003 was negatively affected by<br>a $25.6 million increase in policy acquisition and other<br>operating expenses, primarily due to an increase in<br>commissions and expenses.",
          "The commercial segment’s loss ratio increased as a result of<br>increased claim severity in the commercial multi-peril<br>product line in the 2005 and 2004 accident years in addition<br>to reserve strengthening in the workers compensation product<br>line on prior accident years. The loss ratio in 2004 was<br>lower than what would normally be expected due to redundant<br>development experienced during 2004 coupled with a decline<br>in claim frequency during 2004. Although the farm segment<br>experienced an increase in loss severity in 2005, primarily<br>attributable to fire losses, the increase was more than<br>offset by the increase in net premium earned which caused<br>the decline in the segment’s loss ratio.",

          "The property and casualty insurance segment reported a<br>pretax loss of $14.8 million in 2005, compared to pretax<br>income of $98.4 million in 2004. When comparing our 2005<br>results with those achieved in 2004, the extraordinarily<br>severe 2005 hurricane season is evident. Our property and<br>casualty insurance underwriting results compared unfavorably<br>with the property and casualty insurance industry results as<br>estimated by A.M. Best Company.",
          "Homeowners results were near breakeven in 2000 compared with<br>profitable results in 1999 as a decrease in catastrophe<br>losses was more than offset by an unusually high number of<br>large non-catastrophe losses in 2000, particularly in the<br>first half of the year. Homeowners results in 1999 were less<br>profitable than in 1998 due to an increase in both<br>catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe losses. Results in<br>1999 were also adversely affected by two large losses<br>aggregating $15 million, net of reinsurance.",
          "The decrease in net income, net income available to common<br>shareholders and diluted net income per share in 2005<br>compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to an<br>unprecedented amount of large catastrophic losses for the<br>Company and the industry during 2005.",
          "Current accident year results included approximately $120<br>million of catastrophe losses from the four hurricanes that<br>struck the Southeast United States in the third quarter.<br>Despite these losses, current accident year underwriting<br>results benefited from the favorable effects of re-pricing<br>efforts and improved coverage terms and conditions<br>implemented over the past three years and a one time<br>reduction of $70 million in pension expense during the third<br>quarter, resulting from the curtailment of certain benefits<br>at the end of 2005. Underwriting results for 2003 included<br>net underwriting gains for the current accident year of $200<br>million compared to $66 million in 2002. The current<br>accident year results in 2003 and 2002 reflected re-pricing<br>efforts and unusually low amounts of large individual and<br>catastrophe-related property losses.",

          "The increase in the risk ratio compared with the preceding<br>year was expected because of the unusually low claims trend<br>reported in 2004, due to favorable weather and much fewer<br>claims than usual. Consequently, the risk ratio increased<br>from 54% to 59%. The storms experienced at the beginning of<br>2005 increased the risk ratio by 1.5 percentage points.<br>Increased claims costs within motor third party liability<br>insurance also had an adverse impact on the risk ratio.",

Underwriting<br>results for 2003 included net underwriting gains for the<br>current accident year of $200 million, which reflected re-<br>pricing efforts and unusually small amounts of large<br>individual and catastrophe-related property losses.",
          "This improvement was attributed to an unusually low level of<br>reported loss activity from both proportional and excess of<br>loss business, and from favorable development on prior<br>years' reserves. However, this improvement was partially<br>offset by a significant increase in catastrophe losses<br>($3,411,000 in 2003 compared to $249,000 in 2002).",
          "In addition, there was an increase in the accrual for<br>current and deferred incentive compensation expense but not<br>as much as originally anticipated as our net income<br>decreased due to the catastrophes which occurred during the<br>third quarter of 2004.",
          "For 2007, catastrophe losses added $12.0 million, or 0.9<br>points, to losses. The favorable prior year development in<br>2008 was driven by improvement in our workers compensation<br>line of business, while the prior year development in 2007<br>was driven by lower than expected severity on our commercial<br>automobile line of business.",
          "Improvements in 2002 were due to significantly lower<br>catastrophe losses and milder-than-anticipated weather<br>conditions during 2002 compared to 2001 and the impact of<br>continued rate increases. Homeowners catastrophe losses were<br>$54.3 in 2002 compared to $145.0 in 2001. The underwriting<br>loss in 2001 increased $88.9 over 2000, and the combined<br>ratio increased correspondingly to 127.8% in 2001 from<br>116.0% in 2000. The increased underwriting loss in 2001<br>resulted from the significant catastrophe losses of $145.0<br>in 2001, which included $60.0 for a single catastrophe storm<br>in St. Louis, in comparison to catastrophe losses of $86.0<br>in 2000.",
          "Despite an unusually high level of catastrophe and storm<br>losses ($17,531,000 in 2003 compared to $8,055,000 in 2002)<br>and some necessary reserve strengthening, the loss and<br>settlement expense ratio did not increase appreciably during<br>2003.",
          "The catastrophe losses of 2005 and, to a lesser extent, the<br>catastrophe losses in 2004, will create an unusually large<br>amount of loss payments over the next year that could<br>adversely affect net cash flows from operations.",
          "Overall the Company was disappointed with its 2005 results.<br>The Company generated income of $4.7 million, which was<br>$170.8 million less than 2004‘s net income of $175.5<br>million. This $170.8 million decrease was principally driven<br>by $576.7 million of higher pre-tax catastrophe losses,<br>which were partially offset by $353.6 million of improved<br>non-catastrophe prior year reserve development year over<br>year.",
          "Results in 2005 and 2004 also benefited from unusually low<br>non-catastrophe losses. Results in 2005 deteriorated,<br>however, due to substantially higher catastrophe losses,<br>primarily from Hurricane Katrina.",
          "Net income and net income per share for 2007 and the fourth<br>quarter of 2007, decreased primarily as the result of less<br>than expected earnings in our lending segment and higher<br>than expected expenses for lender, or collateral<br>preservation, assistance in our insurance segment.",
          "However, the domestic marketing program experienced higher<br>than anticipated lapsation on the books of business acquired<br>in the acquisitions of First Alliance Corporation in 2003<br>and CNLIC in 2002, which precipitated the 16.4% decrease in<br>revenues during 2005 compared to 2004.",
          "During 2005, property premiums were adversely affected by a<br>reduction in the surety line of business as a result of a<br>decision by management to restrict writings of contract<br>surety business in response to a greater than expected<br>emergence of surety claims.",
          "The decrease in net income in the fourth quarter of 2005 is<br>primarily attributable to higher than expected Net Loss<br>Ratios on the employer Medical Stop-Loss segment due to<br>claim development in 2005; and a significant reduction in<br>investment income due to lower yields in 2005 as compared to<br>2004.",
          "Reserve development is discussed further in Property<br>Casualty Loss and Loss Expense Obligations and Reserves,<br>Pages 71 through 72. Catastrophe losses fluctuated<br>dramatically over the three-year period, with higher than<br>average contributions to the combined ratio of 5.7 and 6.8<br>percentage points in 2009 and 2008, respectively, following<br>an unusually low 0.8 points in 2007. Our 10-year historical<br>annual average contribution of catastrophe losses to the<br>combined ratio was 4.2 percentage points as of December 31,<br>2009.",
          "These large catastrophe losses contributed 10.0% to the<br>segment loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004.<br>Catastrophe losses were partially offset by lower than<br>expected incurred loss development in the year relating to<br>shorter tail lines prior underwriting years and price<br>improvements on earned premiums from prior periods.",

Catastrophe losses in<br>2002 were unusually low. Additionally, segment income for<br>the year ended December 31, 2003 was negatively affected by<br>a $33.1 million increase in policy acquisition and other<br>operating expenses, primarily due to an increase in special<br>commission and expenses associated with financial guarantee<br>programs designed to minimize the impact to our commercial<br>lines business from the ratings downgrades in 2002.",
          "This results from an excess of enthusiasm in underwriting US<br>liabilities in the late ’90s, a sad and unforeseen disaster<br>in 2001, a random and extreme weather event in 2004, and a<br>worse one in 2005.",

          "In the third quarter of 2005, the property and casualty<br>industry was significantly and adversely affected by the<br>damage and devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. This<br>catastrophe placed unprecedented demands on both the<br>industry and THG. We estimate our after-tax loss from this<br>catastrophe to be approximately $162 million, or $3.00 per<br>share.",
          "Property and marine results were highly profitable in each<br>of the past three years, particularly in 2004 due in part to<br>unusually low losses. Results in each year benefited from<br>improved pricing, higher deductibles, better terms and<br>conditions and a low number of severe losses. The strong<br>results in 2003 were achieved despite a $25 million loss<br>that resulted from an adverse arbitration decision rendered<br>against an insurance pool in which we were formerly a<br>participant. The decision related to a fire that occurred in<br>1995.",

          "Excluding the impact of the hurricanes, 2005 had worse than<br>expected underwriting experience due to some unusually large<br>international losses, while 2006 underwriting results were<br>better than expected, due in part to the release of<br>redundant reserves on the 2004 and 2005 accident years.",

As of December 31,<br>2012, the discount rate had declined over the last five<br>years from 6.5% to 4.0%, due to the decline in the weighted<br>average yields of the investments that qualify for<br>consideration to establish the assumption for the discount<br>rate. Also, plan assets sustained net losses in 2008<br>primarily due to declines in equity and credit markets.",

As a result,<br>the principal contributor to the $169.8 million decrease in<br>income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008<br>compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, was the $161.6<br>million year-over-year decrease in net gains on alternative<br>investments.",
          "The 2010 actuarial loss was primarily due to the change in<br>the discount rate assumption used to measure the future<br>benefit obligations to 5.69% in 2010 from 6.11% in 2009.<br>Although Indemnity is the sponsor of these postretirement<br>plans and records the funded status of these plans,<br>generally the Exchange and EFL reimburse Indemnity for<br>approximately 57% of the annual benefit expense of these<br>plans. At December 31, 2009, shareholders’ equity increased<br>by $24 million, net of tax, of which $2 million represents<br>amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial<br>loss and $22 million represents the current period actuarial<br>gain. The 2009 actuarial gain was primarily due to greater<br>than expected actual investment returns.",
          "The 2008 actuarial loss was primarily due to a significant<br>difference in the plan’s actual investment returns in 2008<br>from the expected returns assumed and the decrease in the<br>discount rate assumption used to estimate the future benefit<br>obligations to 6.06% in 2008 from 6.62% in 2007.",
          "For the year ended December 31, 2011, the pension plans had<br>a loss primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate and<br>less than expected asset returns.",
          "In 2011, primarily as a result of a decline in the discount<br>rates used to value our pension and other postretirement<br>obligations, and lower than expected return on plan assets,<br>the liability related to our pension and other<br>postretirement benefit plans increased.",
          "During 2010, the Company’s postretirement benefits liability<br>adjustment increased by $301 million pre-tax ($189 million<br>after-tax) resulting in a decrease to shareholders’ equity.<br>The increase in the liability was primarily due to a<br>decrease in the discount rate, and an update to the<br>mortality assumption to provide for mortality improvement,<br>partially offset by 2010 investment returns in excess of<br>expectations.",
          "Results from pension and employee benefits decreased $70<br>million, primarily reflecting lower income from our<br>qualified pension plan, driven by lower expected returns on<br>plan assets due to lower than expected plan fixed income<br>asset growth in 2015, as well as higher interest costs on<br>the plan obligation due to a higher discount rate.",
          "As noted above, as of December 31, 2009 actual cumulative<br>earnings are below the expected cumulative earnings by $601<br>million.",
          "The unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit<br>cost as of December 31, 2011 was $1.43 billion, an increase<br>of $239 million from $1.19 billion as of December 31, 2010.<br>The increase was the result of a lower discount rate used to<br>value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations<br>along with asset returns that were less than expected.",
          "Net actuarial losses in 2015 resulted primarily from lower<br>than expected investment gains that were experienced during<br>the year that were partially offset by a slight increase<br>from the change in the discount rate as compared to the<br>prior year.",
          "The 2009 projected benefit obligation for the postretirement<br>benefit plans includes a significant actuarial loss, which<br>is attributed to actual participant contributions being less<br>than expected and several assumption changes.",
          "Actuarial loss was due to the difference in the actual<br>return on plan assets versus the expected return on plan<br>assets, driven by the volatile market conditions experienced<br>in 2008 and the decrease in the discount rate to 6.06% in<br>2008 from 6.62% in 2007.",
          "An actuarial loss of $44.0 million occurred during 2008 for<br>the other postretirement benefit plans. This was due to a<br>decrease in the discount rate and a less than expected<br>increase in retiree contributions, which was partially<br>offset by a decrease in the trend assumption and a less than<br>expected increase in health care claim costs.",
          "The decline in Qualified Pension Plan asset performance<br>prior to 2006, combined with historically low interest rates<br>(which are the key assumption in estimating plan<br>liabilities) caused the Company to record a $30.3 million<br>increase in its accrued Qualified Pension Plan liability and<br>record a $19.7 million charge to shareholders’ equity. In<br>2006 and 2007, the Company reversed $5.7 million and $5.4<br>million of its qualified pension liability and increased<br>shareholders’ equity by $3.7 million and $3.5 million,<br>respectively, due primarily to the increases in interest<br>rates and higher than expected returns on plan assets. In<br>2008, the Company increased its qualified pension liability<br>by $26.8 million and recorded a charge to shareholders’<br>equity of $17.4 million due primarily to a decrease in the<br>value of the investments that support these obligations.",
          "For the year ended December 31, 2012, the pension plans had<br>a loss primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate,<br>which was offset by higher than expected asset returns.",
          "The increase in expenses is driven by higher amortization of<br>actuarial losses and lower expected returns on plan assets<br>due to lower than expected asset growth in 2015.",
          "The liability related to our pension and other<br>postretirement benefit plans increased in 2011, primarily as<br>a result of actuarial losses attributable to a decline in<br>the discount rates used to value our pension and other<br>postretirement obligations, and lower than expected return<br>on plan assets.",

In response, the U.S.<br>government and its agencies have taken a number of<br>significant measures to provide fiscal and monetary<br>stimulus. Such actions include an unscheduled cut to the<br>federal funds rate, the introduction of new programs to<br>preserve market liquidity, extended unemployment and sick<br>leave benefits, mortgage loan forbearance actions, low-<br>interest loans for working capital access and payroll<br>assistance, and other relief measures for both workers and<br>businesses.",

Central banks are likely to cut policy<br>rates further and stay very accommodative in this<br>environment of elevated uncertainty. The US Federal Reserve<br>has already enacted two surprise interest rate cuts for a<br>total of 150bp in March.",
          "Unexpectedly, reports of a seriously infectious virus<br>started spreading rapidly. We soon realised that the world<br>was facing a new pandemic, but none of us could have<br>predicted that the situation would prevail for so long.

The<br>impact on the Group’s insurance liabilities as a result of<br>the global pandemic has been recognised (see note 47 for<br>long-term business and note 42(c(iv)) for general insurance<br>and health business).

From the outset, our top priority<br>was to protect the health of our employees and customers.

After significant<br>contractions in 2020, the global economy is expected to<br>experience a protracted and uneven recovery in 2021. The<br>impact of the pandemic on recovery of individual economies<br>will be affected by their respective capacities to absorb<br>shocks and the fiscal responses of their governments, and<br>more broadly by continuing uncertainties over the impact of<br>new strains of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines<br>against new strains, the timeline for the rollout of<br>vaccination programs, the duration of immunity and resulting<br>restrictions on mobility. Despite the impact of the pandemic<br>on the global economy, the global insurance markets (as<br>measured by premium growth) were less severely impacted in<br>2020 than expected (although the life market was more<br>adversely affected than the non-life market) and premium<br>growth is expected to recover, alongside recovery of the<br>global economy, in 2021 and 2022, supported by rate<br>hardening.",

          "Major losses – in excess of €10m each – totalled €2,152m<br>(4,314m) in 2018, after retrocession and before tax. This<br>amount includes run-off profits and losses for major claims<br>from previous years, and is equivalent to 11.6% of net<br>earned premium. It is much lower than in the previous year,<br>and also slightly below our major-loss expectation of 12% of<br>net earned premium.",
          "We had to carry a load in excess of EUR 1 billion from<br>catastrophe losses in our retention in the year under<br>review; the hurricanes alone cost us around EUR 800 million.<br>This historically unparalleled burden quite literally swept<br>away our profit.",
          "While major loss expenditure in 2018 was lower than in the<br>previous year, the loss events resulted in a total strain<br>slightly in excess of our expectations.",
          "Major-loss expenditure totalling €1,249m (903m) after<br>retrocession and before tax was higher than in the previous<br>year, but nevertheless remained below expectations.",
          "Major loss expenditure in the year under review was lower<br>than in 2013. Although the hurricane season once again<br>passed off unremarkably, a number of natural catastrophe<br>events were recorded. In Western Europe, for example, the<br>low pressure area Ela caused extensive damage. The resulting<br>net strain for Hannover Re’s account was EUR 15.9 million.<br>For the aviation line the year under review was a<br>particularly costly one.",
          "Overall, COVID-19 losses of USD 27 million for Life Capital<br>are within expectations, given the underlying businesses.",
          "But 2019 will probably be most remembered for a<br>deterioration in loss ratio (2019 underwriting year is<br>projected around 77% v 74% for 2018 at the same point of<br>development) when we were expecting the opposite.",
          "Major-loss expenditure totalling €2,686m (1,316m) after<br>retrocession and before tax was significantly higher than in<br>the previous year and above our expectations.",
          "First, we had to record discounts on book value from the<br>sale of loans which were carried out more quickly than<br>planned; second, we made additions to the loan loss<br>provisions for loans at risk. The share of these loans is<br>far higher in the IRU than in the strategic business. The<br>IRU recorded a loss after taxes of 933 million euros.",
          "While the higher-than-average strains from natural<br>catastrophe losses adversely impacted the result recorded by<br>Hannover Re, they will have no lasting effect on our<br>profitability or capitalisation. Quite the contrary: the<br>losses have led to a renewed improvement in market<br>conditions for reinsurers.",
          "Why did you announce, just one month after publishing your<br>half-year results for 2014, that you expected a net loss for<br>the full year – was this not foreseeable a few weeks<br>earlier? When our half-year results were published, we were<br>unable to foresee the impact of the events that made it<br>necessary to adjust our outlook. It was only in the weeks<br>that followed that the Ukrainian army lost control again<br>over the eastern parts of the country to the separatists.<br>The increased fighting not only stopped us from reopening<br>many of our branches there, but of course also greatly<br>exacerbated the economic situation.",
          "Furthermore, heavy overall losses were caused by weather<br>events in Hannover Re’s domestic German market towards the<br>middle of the year, while at the same time discussions were<br>ongoing in relation to the effects of the low interest rate<br>environment on the investment return generated by insurers<br>and reinsurers. Against this backdrop the share ultimately<br>sank to its lowest point of the year of EUR 52.42 on 6<br>September. The price recovery that subsequently set in was<br>driven inter alia by a loss experience that remained within<br>expectations overall as well as by a more intensive dialogue<br>initiated with investors in view of the concerns mentioned<br>above.",
          "Non-Core losses declined again (32% to £2.9 billion) and<br>Non-Core assets also fell ahead of target to £57 billion. We<br>expect to slow the pace and cost of the remaining run-down<br>once we hit the £40 billion asset target for the end of<br>2013. Exceptional charges in relation to Payment Protection<br>Insurance claims, LIBOR settlements and interest rate<br>hedging product redress, together with the own credit<br>adjustment, resulted in a loss before tax of £5,165 million.",
          "Besides major-loss expenditure being higher than expected<br>owing in particular to COVID-19 losses, this result can be<br>attributed to the negative influence of the capital markets.",
          "Having presented a record profit for 2007, Hannover Re is<br>now reporting a loss for the first time in its history. This<br>is indeed painful. As a large investor with an asset volume<br>of some EUR 20 billion, we were unfortunately unable to<br>escape the effects of the crisis on financial markets:<br>despite our prudent and diversified investment strategy, the<br>third quarter, in particular, compelled us to take<br>significant write-downs – first and foremost on equity<br>holdings.",
          "Amounting to 20.8% of net earned premiums, major-loss<br>expenditure significantly surpassed our majorloss<br>expectation of 12% of net premiums. Man-made major losses<br>were a significant contributory factor, with COVID19<br>-related expenditure amounting to €3,066m.",

All areas contributed<br>to the profit. Approximately 3.3 (9.0) percentage points of<br>the combined ratio of 78.9% (92.9%) were attributable to<br>expenditure for retrocession cover for the whole reinsurance<br>group, which we account for in Special and Financial Risks.",

          "After the unusually heavy loss expenditure incurred in the<br>previous year, the major loss experience in the year under<br>review was on the moderate side. The largest single loss was<br>a fire at a spare parts storage facility of a Saudi Arabian<br>airline, for which we have set aside net reserves of around<br>EUR 13 million.",
          "Total net expenditure on catastrophe losses and major claims<br>amounted to EUR 285.4 million (EUR 107.3 million ); this<br>figure corresponds to 6.3% of net premium in non-life<br>reinsurance and was thus slightly below the expected figure<br>of 8%.",

          "For Hannover Re too these loss events resulted in a hitherto<br>unprecedented burden of natural catastrophes. Hurricanes<br>\"Katrina\", \"Rita\" and \"Wilma\" alone produced a strain of EUR<br>797.9 million for our net account. These and other major<br>losses – such as the winter storm \"Erwin\" in Northern<br>Europe, flooding in the Alps, damage to an oil platform in<br>the Indian Ocean, several aviation claims and floods in<br>Mumbai, India – left us with net loss expenditure of EUR 1.0<br>billion (EUR 287.2 million).",
          "The year under review suffered under higher-than-average<br>loss expenditure. The largest individual loss for our<br>company was the crash of an Air France jet with a net strain<br>of EUR 33.8 million.",
          "The business results posted by Clarendon in the year under<br>review were disappointing – principally due to the strains<br>associated with the four hurricanes in Florida. Gross<br>premium income contracted by 22.8% to EUR 1.8 billion (EUR<br>2.4 billion). The decrease was in part so dramatic because<br>of the weakness of the US dollar against the euro – at<br>constant exchange rates the decline would have been 15.1%.",
          "While we were able to reduce administrative expenses more<br>than originally planned, cost management alone was unable to<br>stem the tide, particularly since earnings were hit by loan<br>loss provisions that climbed to 1.6 billion euros.",
          "After a very moderate major loss experience in the first<br>half of 2018, the loss incidence in the third quarter was<br>essentially in line with our quarterly expectations. The<br>most significant losses incurred in the third quarter<br>included Typhoon “Jebi” in Japan, with an anticipated net<br>strain for our account of EUR 134.7 million.",
          "These and other major losses combined to produce net<br>expenditure for 2013 of altogether EUR 577.6 million (EUR<br>477.8 million). Although this figure was higher than in the<br>previous year, the burden of major losses nevertheless came<br>in below our expected level of EUR 625 million.",
          "The major loss experience in the year under review proved to<br>be better than expected. The largest single event for our<br>portfolio was a satellite loss, resulting in a net strain of<br>around EUR 9 million for our account.",
          "In his address to shareholders Chief Executive Officer<br>Ulrich Wallin took the opportunity to look back on the 2017<br>financial year, which was notable for significantly more<br>loss events after five comparatively benign years. In<br>particular, hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria – along with<br>other natural catastrophes – inflicted heavy insured losses.<br>Hannover Re, in common with other market players, was<br>substantially impacted. The company nevertheless generated a<br>result that translated into a return on equity of 10.9% and<br>comfortably beat the minimum target of 900 basis points<br>above the risk-free interest rate.",
          "This Supervisory Body also verified the levels of<br>materiality of the risks for BancoPosta with particular<br>regard to risks of high relevance: (i) to \"financial<br>leverage\", which is structurally higher than that of a bank<br>due to the composition of BancoPosta assets; the Leverage<br>Ratio, which had been brought back to the target value of 3%<br>set in the 2020 RAF by setting aside €85 million in profits<br>generated in 2019, resumed a downward trend during 2020, due<br>to the extraordinary and unexpected",

          "The net loss expenditure for Hannover Re was roughly EUR 258<br>million. However, given the additional premiums of around<br>EUR 24 million booked for our net account due to experience-<br>based treaty conditions, the strain is reduced to EUR 234<br>million. Major loss expenditures in the year under review<br>nevertheless remained well below the expected level of EUR<br>560 million calculated at the beginning of the year.",
          "The 2019 financial year, just like the two previous years,<br>was adversely impacted by large losses that exceeded our<br>expectations. While the first six months again recorded a<br>thoroughly moderate major loss experience, the volume of<br>losses incurred in the second half of the year was<br>significantly higher than anticipated.",
          "These and other major losses (see also page 88) resulted in<br>net loss expenditure for our company totalling EUR 425.7<br>million (EUR 577.6 million), a figure well below our<br>expected level of EUR 670 million.",

Of these claims, we also experienced a higher than<br>anticipated level of severity. Despite these challenges<br>resulting from the uniqueness of this storm, based upon the<br>information we currently have available to us, we believe<br>that at December 31, 2005, the level of incurred costs we<br>have recorded for Hurricane Katrina represents an adequate<br>estimate of the ultimate impact this storm will have on our<br>financial results.",
          "The news is doubtless more than familiar from the media: in<br>late August 2005 hurricane \"Katrina\" laid waste to the city<br>of New Orleans and the southern United States on a hitherto<br>unprecedented scale. With an estimated market loss of USD 50<br>billion \"Katrina\" took over as the most expensive insured<br>event of all time.",
          "In 2005, reinsurance was affected by a hurricane season<br>hitherto unprecedented in terms of loss amount (see page<br>70).",
          "The 2004 combined ratio was higher than 2003 primarily due<br>to losses relating to the four storms in the southeastern<br>United States that impacted IMU and better than expected<br>weather losses in 2003.",
          "The Company’s results for 2005 were significantly impacted<br>by the unprecedented insured hurricane losses during the<br>2005 Atlantic hurricane season, the charge related to the<br>conclusion of the independent actuarial process with<br>Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company and adverse development<br>of prior year loss reserves in both insurance professional<br>lines and reinsurance casualty lines.",
          "We experienced unusually high catastrophe losses in 2005<br>from Hurricane Katrina, and to a lesser extent, Hurricane<br>Rita.",
          "Due to the unprecedented hurricane activity in 2004 and<br>2005, we have experienced a significant increase in the cost<br>of our catastrophe reinsurance over the last three years.",

          "Although we regularly check the loss scenarios underlying<br>the accumulation budgets, we are nevertheless not immune to<br>misestimation. Thus the effects of Hurricane Katrina<br>significantly exceeded our expectations with regard to a<br>natural catastrophe of this type and intensity.",

          "Given the magnitude of these events, delays in receiving<br>claims data, uncertainty surrounding final industry losses<br>reported by statistical reporting agencies which impact our<br>reinsurance recoveries, the unusual legal and claim issues<br>related to certain of the events, particularly but not<br>exclusively hurricane Katrina, and other uncertainties<br>inherent in loss estimation, meaningful additional<br>uncertainty remains regarding total covered losses for the<br>insurance industry from these events.",

          "The exceptional number and severity of the hurricanes in the<br>Gulf of Mexico made 2005 a record year for us in terms of<br>insured natural catastrophe losses.",
          "Catastrophe losses were unusually high in 2004 due to four<br>hurricanes in the Southeast.",
          "During 2005, there was an unprecedented quantum of natural<br>catastrophes. Collectively, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and<br>Wilma had a substantial impact on the Company’s results of<br>operations and financial condition.",

          "The year under review saw exceptionally severe losses in<br>marine insurance; in addition to a major claim involving an<br>oil platform in the Indian Ocean, we incurred extremely<br>heavy loss expenditure from hurricanes \"Katrina\" and \"Rita\".",
          "The Company’s estimated losses resulting from hurricane<br>Katrina are subject to an unusual level of uncertainty<br>arising out of these losses’ extremely complex and unique<br>causation and related coverage issues associated with the<br>attribution of losses to wind or flood damage or other<br>perils such as fire, business interruption or riot and civil<br>commotion.",
          "Therefore the losses from Hurricane Katrina were<br>significantly higher than we would have expected on the<br>basis of our models for a hurricane of comparable strength.",
          "However, 2005 eventually developed into the worst year in<br>the history of the industry in terms of catastrophe losses,<br>with Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast in<br>late August, being the largest insured event ever. The<br>catastrophic events of 2005, which included two other<br>significant Atlantic hurricanes, Rita and Wilma, as well as<br>a significant winterstorm and a flood in Europe, followed an<br>unusually active Atlantic hurricane season in 2004.<br>Consequently, the Company observed in 2006 strong pricing<br>increases in the lines and geographies that were affected by<br>the large 2005 catastrophic loss events, including<br>catastrophe covers in the southeastern U.S. and in the U.S.<br>property and energy lines.",
          "The cost of catastrophe reinsurance coverage, which reduced<br>total earned premiums, was $15.7 million for the year ended<br>December 31, 2006, including an additional charge of $0.3<br>million to reinstate reinsurance coverage due primarily to<br>higher reinsured losses from Hurricane Katrina than<br>previously anticipated.",
          "Catastrophe losses were unusually high in 2004 due to four<br>significant hurricanes in the Southeast.",
          "Nevertheless, 2005 was a turning point for the market: it<br>brought high-severity losses of exceptional frequency, not<br>only in the USA, creating a profound disturbance within the<br>Non Life (Re)insurance industry.",
          "Following on the heels of last year's heavy losses, the US<br>market was once more overshadowed by a historically<br>unprecedented and highly costly hurricane season.",
          "In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita resulted in<br>considerable gross losses that required unusually higher<br>payments to claimants following the storms.",
          "We experienced unusually high catastrophe losses in 2005<br>from Hurricane Katrina, and to a lesser extent, Hurricane<br>Rita.",
          "It also ran in parallel to a record number of large loss<br>assessment processes, which were triggered by the<br>extraordinary number of hurricanes in the North Atlantic.",
          "There can be no doubt that the year under review was one of<br>the most eventful in recent memory: all four of our business<br>groups had to cope with exceptional events, most notably the<br>four hurricanes in the Caribbean and the United States with<br>associated heavy losses for the insurance and reinsurance<br>industries.",
          "Result The devastating hurricane season in the Gulf of<br>Mexico had a massive impact on the result for 2005. The<br>local oil platforms were affected by Hurricanes Katrina and<br>Rita to an unprecedented degree. The two hurricanes are<br>among the largest losses ever to affect the marine market.",
          "Yet there was no way to make up for the unparalleled burden<br>of catastrophe losses. Nevertheless, we very quickly turned<br>our attention in property and casualty reinsurance – as we<br>always do – to the future: hurricane \"Katrina\" clearly<br>demonstrated that the simulation models used by insurers and<br>reinsurers for risk analysis and pricing calculations had<br>not functioned correctly.",

After<br>these items, GBM recorded negative income of £2,520 million.<br>Although direct costs were cut by 18%, credit impairments<br>rose sharply, resulting in a 2008 operating loss of £10,994<br>million.",

The<br>lower return was primarily due to a relatively low return on<br>Danish mortgage bonds as compared to the comparable<br>revaluation of provisions and the very low short-term<br>interest rates.",
          "The increase in expenses more than offset the increase in<br>revenues from the expansion projects, which were<br>approximately $122 million lower than expected due to<br>operating the expansion pipelines at reduced operating<br>pressures and portions of the expansion pipelines being shut<br>down for periods of time during 2009.",

          "The loss ratios for the older accident years increased due<br>to the combination of higher than expected loss development<br>in the year and the increase in the loss development factor<br>assumptions.",
          "The loss performance we experienced in the second half of<br>2007 was more substantial and occurred more quickly than we<br>anticipated. Our loss performance, particularly in<br>California and Florida, deteriorated at a rate we have not<br>previously experienced.",
          "CCI’s claim ratio for all of 2014 reflected even higher<br>provisions due to a litigated claim settlement in an amount<br>greater than originally anticipated.",
          "The increase in the loss ratio for 2002 was primarily the<br>result of development in the workers' compensation line<br>related to higher than anticipated indemnity and medical<br>exposure for accident years 2000 and 2001.",
          "The receipt of these additional late claims beyond the 12<br>week period created a situation whereby the updated third<br>quarter medical loss ratio is approximately 5% higher than<br>originally estimated. Additionally, higher than expected<br>fourth quarter Medicare utilization (together with the third<br>quarter adverse development) generated medical costs<br>approximately $2.2 million above projections.",
          "The year-over-year increase in the loss ratio was primarily<br>due to higher than expected claim frequency and severity<br>across multiple coverages principally in property damage<br>liability and collision claims.",
          "Approximately $5.8 million of this increase was attributable<br>to Florida where we experienced higher than expected<br>ultimate severity trends in the personal injury protection<br>(“PIP”) coverage, a portion of which related to the runoff<br>of claims from the Miami market, and higher ultimate<br>frequency and severity trends in the property damage<br>coverage, largely associated with an increase in post-<br>closing payments.",

          "This increase was due to (i) increases in average severity<br>for Personal Injury Protection (No-fault) losses of $9.4<br>million (ii) higher Commercial Auto Liability projected loss<br>ratios for 2002-2004 due to the fact that actual loss<br>development was higher than expected for those years,<br>resulting in an increase of $1.8 million and (iii)<br>Homeowners losses of $0.6 million and Other Liability losses<br>of $1.6 million.",

          "The increase in the net loss ratio was primarily due to<br>higher current accident year loss trends and claims<br>developing much worse than anticipated due to rapid growth<br>in the Florida claim volume and the complexity related to<br>Florida personal injury protection claims.",
          "Loss development was primarily related to higher than<br>expected severity with Florida personal injury protection<br>claims and with Georgia bodily injury claims in older<br>accident periods.

          "Our 2004 loss ratio would have been 74.0% excluding the<br>impact of the adverse development relating to prior years.<br>Approximately $4.5 million of this increase was attributable<br>to higher than expected frequency and severity trends in the<br>Florida personal injury protection (“PIP”) and property<br>damage coverages that were offset by better than expected<br>loss trends in bodily injury coverage. A significant<br>component of the increase in PIP reserves was related to<br>higher than expected reported frequency and closed with<br>payment trends, which we believe was",

          "The increase in the Aviation Division loss ratio in 1995 is<br>primarily attributed to the adverse results in the three<br>classes of coverages, which were discontinued in 1995, and a<br>higher-than-expected number of severe liability losses in<br>the 1994 and prior accident years. The P&C Division loss<br>ratio increased due to the continued adverse results of the<br>auto dealer program and a longer than anticipated<br>development period for the other liability coverages line of<br>business.",
          "Claims ratios in 2012 were affected by higher loss costs for<br>the aggregate commercial automobile (trucking), general<br>liability, and workers' compensation coverages. 2013 ratios<br>remained at relatively high levels as workers' compensation<br>and general liability loss costs continued to reflect<br>greater-than-expected severity.",
          "The percentage increase in losses, which was substantially<br>greater than the percentage increase in net premiums earned,<br>was primarily attributable to a $17.5 million addition to<br>loss reserves in the third quarter due to adverse medical<br>malpractice claims development in Florida resulting from the<br>higher than anticipated dollar settlements.",
          "The increase was largely attributable to an 8.2 percentage<br>point increase in the loss ratio in 2016, compared to 2015<br>attributable to higher than expected losses in Florida<br>homeowners, commercial auto, commercial liability products<br>and the personal auto run-off.",
          "The occurrence of the $12.0 million bankruptcy related loss<br>in the third quarter of 2002 significantly increased the<br>estimated branch contract and commercial net accident year<br>loss ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. Due<br>to the occurrence of this loss and other adverse loss<br>trends, together with the uncertain outlook for the economy<br>and credit markets, the Company raised its expected baseline<br>accident year net loss ratio on the branch contract and<br>commercial business to 36.0 percent for the fourth quarter<br>from the initial 2002 accident year net loss ratio of 30.0<br>percent.",

          "The loss ratio for the Florida homeowners' insurance<br>contracts also increased during the year ended December 31,<br>2015 due to unfavorable loss development primarily as a<br>result of sinkhole claims, higher than anticipated water<br>damage claims from rainstorms and an increase in the<br>practice of \"assignment of benefits\" whereby homeowners<br>assign their rights for filing and settling claims to<br>attorneys and public adjusters which led to increases in the<br>frequency of claims reported as well as the severity of loss<br>adjustment expenses.",

          "The unfavorable change in the estimate of unpaid losses and<br>loss adjustment expenses of $4.0 million for the year ended<br>December 31, 2012 was primarily due to higher than expected<br>severity with Florida personal injury protection claims and<br>with Georgia bodily injury claims in older accident periods,<br>and unfavorable loss adjustment expense development that was<br>primarily related to higher than expected legal expenses for<br>bodily injury claims for accident years 2010 and prior.",

Included in losses and loss<br>adjustment expenses for the 2007 accident year was $2.5<br>million attributable to storm losses which occurred in<br>December 2007 in the Northwest and Midwest.",
          "In addition, there was $9.8 million of adverse development<br>in program business, including $2.8 million and $6.8 million<br>from the 2003 and 2004 accident years on a small number of<br>programs. Favorable development was indicated on healthcare<br>business, with $13.8 million of releases from the 2004 to<br>2008 accident years resulting from a continuation of better<br>than expected loss emergence, and on marine business, with<br>$4.6 million of releases in the 2009 accident year.",
          "This balance consisted of net adverse development of $54<br>million on the 2009 accident year, as we finalized<br>settlements for certain loss events and reduced our recovery<br>estimates for the latest available information. Partially<br>offsetting this amount was $36 million in net favorable<br>prior year reserve development on the 2006 through 2008<br>accident years, in recognition of better than anticipated<br>loss emergence on our CEND and credit business.",
          "Partially offsetting this net favorable development was a<br>$4.8 million addition due to higher than expected property<br>losses for the current accident year.",
          "The development in 2009 is primarily attributable to<br>unfavorable development in the workers’ compensation line of<br>business of $2,173 and the commercial auto liability line of<br>business of $740, partially offset by favorable development<br>in the fire and allied line of business of $636 and the<br>liability line of business of $478. The workers’<br>compensation development was the result of a higher level of<br>incurred loss emergence relative to expectations for the<br>2008 and 2007 accident years and the reduction of ceded<br>losses under the aggregate stop loss contract. The<br>commercial auto liability development was primarily the<br>result of adverse case development on previously reported<br>claims.",
          "We recorded unfavorable prior year loss development of $2.3<br>million in 2009. We recorded favorable prior year loss<br>development of $0.5 million in 2008 and $3.0 million in 2007<br>due primarily to the impact of the legislation on medical<br>claim costs being more favorable than previously<br>anticipated.",
          "This was partially offset by net adverse development of $44<br>million on the 2008 accident year, primarily reflecting<br>higher than expected loss activity on financial institutions<br>business as a result of the global financial crisis.",
          "The favorable development in these lines was partly offset<br>by unfavorable development of approximately $1,501 in our<br>workers’ compensation line due to a higher level of incurred<br>loss emergence relative to expectations for the 2008 and<br>2007 accident years.",
          "Another contributor to the adverse development during 2008<br>and 2009 is that actual loss development for other large<br>losses for accident years 1998 and subsequent have emerged<br>at higher than expected levels as compared to the loss<br>emergence pattern exhibited from earlier accident years.",
          "Favorable development for general liabilities and automobile<br>lines totaled $7.2 million for accident years 2002 through<br>2005 and $0.4 million for property lines due to lower than<br>expected frequency and severity. Partially offsetting this<br>favorable development on prior accident years was $4.5<br>million in unfavorable development due to the unwinding of<br>the workers compensation reserve discount. Included in<br>losses and loss adjustment expenses for the 2007 accident<br>year was $2.5 million in reserve increases for storm losses<br>which occurred in December 2007 in the Northwest and<br>Midwest.",
          "This was partially offset by net adverse development on<br>accident year 2008 business ($44 million), primarily<br>reflecting higher than expected loss activity associated<br>with the financial crisis on financial institutions<br>business.",
          "Partially offsetting this net favorable development was a<br>$2.4 million addition due to higher than expected property<br>losses for the current accident year.",
          "Even with these higher loss development factors, during the<br>fourth quarter of 2010, loss emergence across all accident<br>years for excess casualty was approximately $115 million<br>worse than expected and was concentrated in accident years<br>2007 and 2008.",
          "Partially offsetting the favorable development was an<br>increase to the current accident year of $2.4 million due to<br>September storm activity and higher than expected losses in<br>the automobile liability line of business.",
          "Partially offsetting this net favorable development was a<br>$4.8 million addition due to higher than expected property<br>losses for the 2007 accident year.",
          "This was driven by adverse development of $40 million on<br>accident year 2008, reflecting updated loss information<br>received from our cedants this year. This was partially<br>offset by favorable development on earlier accident years<br>reflecting the recognition of better than expected loss<br>emergence.",
          "Development on the 2009 accident year was primarily driven<br>by better than expected loss emergence, while the<br>development on the 2005 accident year largely related to a<br>reduction in our reserve for one particular claim following<br>receipt of updated information. Partially offsetting this,<br>we recognized net adverse development of $33 million on the<br>2008 accident year, largely related to updated information<br>with respect to Hurricane Ike losses.",
          "The higher than expected loss emergence in the last half of<br>2010, particularly in the fourth quarter, led management to<br>select higher loss development factors than those selected<br>in 2009 because greater weight was placed on the adverse<br>development in the recent calendar years (i.e., the three<br>most recent calendar years).",
          "In 2007, we experienced $93.1 million of favorable<br>development which improved our calendar year loss ratio by<br>12.8 percentage points, principally as a result of a<br>reduction of ultimate losses for the 2006 and 2005 accident<br>years, due to lower than expected reported claims. In 2006,<br>we experienced $13.9 million of adverse development on prior<br>year reserves, which increased our calendar year net claims<br>and claims expenses ratio by 1.9 percentage points.",
          "In 2009, the Company recognized unfavorable prior year<br>development of $35, principally driven by higher projected<br>unallocated loss adjustment expenses. The Company recognized<br>favorable prior year development of $30 in 2008 for its<br>HartRe assumed reinsurance liabilities principally driven by<br>lower than expected reported losses.",

The resulting loss ratio, excluding<br>catastrophes and development, decreased due to a lower<br>proportion of crop business, which had a higher loss ratio<br>than the remainder of the segment, and a higher proportion<br>of catastrophe business, which had a lower loss ratio than<br>the remainder of the segment. Net favorable loss development<br>for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily<br>attributable to a level of cumulative losses reported by our<br>ceding companies that was lower than we expected and that,<br>in our judgment, resulted in sufficient credibility in the<br>loss experience to change our previously selected loss<br>ratios. The change in our estimate of the administrative<br>costs of managing claims in the year ended December 31, 2010<br>decreased the net loss and LAE ratio by 0.3 points.",
          "Losses and LAE increased $20.0 million, or 15.5%, for 2007<br>compared to 2006. The loss and LAE ratio for the year ended<br>December 31, 2007 was 58.0% compared to 59.6% for the year<br>ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the loss and LAE<br>ratio in 2007 of 1.6 percentage points is primarily due to a<br>decrease in loss severity in 2007 as there was higher than<br>anticipated claims severity in 2006 experienced in many of<br>our larger products.",
          "Excluding prior year loss development, the net loss and LAE<br>ratio for 2017 was 65.9% compared to 63.6% for 2016,<br>reflecting higher initial expected loss ratios for premiums<br>earned during the period.",
          "The decrease in the loss and LAE ratio was mainly due to 9<br>points of favorable loss reserve development in 2008<br>primarily related to lower than expected severity in<br>professional liability, compared to 4 points in 2007<br>primarily related to lower than expected frequency in<br>professional liability. Partially offsetting this decrease<br>was a 2 point increase in current accident year losses in<br>2008, mainly due to large losses at IMU. Additionally, 2008<br>included 2 points of catastrophe losses, primarily from<br>hurricane Ike, compared to 1 point of catastrophe losses in<br>2007.",

This resulted in a loss and LAE ratio of<br>55.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to<br>62.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in<br>losses and LAE was related to a 19.3% increase in net<br>premiums earned and was partially offset by a decrease of<br>$39.0 million on losses and LAE attributable to 2005 and<br>prior years, principally due to favorable loss emergence on<br>medical malpractice in the period. For the year ended<br>December 31, 2005, losses and LAE related to 2004 and prior<br>years decreased by $9.0 million, principally due to loss<br>emergence less than expectations in 2005 on medical<br>malpractice and general liability exposures.",
          "The loss and LAE ratio was also higher due to large losses<br>in specialty lines at IMU and in the non-specialty middle<br>market commercial businesses.

In life and health<br>reinsurance, we posted a technical result of €428m (561m).<br>This figure is just below the profit of €450m we forecast at<br>the start of the year, and is actually higher than the<br>reduced target of €400m projected in August.",

Interest<br>rates at December 31, 2004 were at approximately the same<br>levels as December 2003.

These<br>prepayment adjustments totaled $5.4 in 2003 compared with<br>$13.9 in 2002.

Also<br>contributing to the decrease in net investment income is the<br>decrease in income on fixed maturities resulting from the<br>amortization of the premium recognized on such securities at<br>the Acquisition Date as a result of the application of<br>purchase accounting coupled with the reinvestment of the<br>proceeds of the portfolio repositioning during the second<br>half of the year in fixed maturities yielding lower interest<br>rates. These decreases in net investment income are offset<br>by increased income from the expansion of the securities<br>lending program. The increase in investment expenses also<br>results from this increase in the securities lending<br>program. Additionally, while net investment income on other<br>limited partnerships was higher than anticipated during the<br>six months ended June 30, 2005 due to better than expected<br>performance on such investments, it was lower in the six<br>months ended December 31, 2005 as result of a conforming<br>change in accounting principle whereby many of such<br>investments were converted to the cost basis of",

The case base<br>redundancy was due in part to our response to the loss<br>reserve deficiencies for the December 31, 2002 loss reserves<br>that were ultimately discovered during 2003. Both our<br>property and liability lines developed a deficiency in 2003.<br>Collectively, the December 31, 2002 loss reserves developed<br>a deficiency of approximately 10 percent, or $12 million, in<br>2003.",

The Company's<br>effective federal income tax (benefit) rate was (65.5%) in<br>1998 compared to 25.9% in 1997.

There had been a<br>positive effect of CHF 35.5 million resulting from pension<br>scheme changes (IAS 19) in 2016, whereas earnings in 2017<br>were squeezed by the strengthening of the employer<br>contribution reserve in the pension fund for employees.

In occupational pension plans in<br>Switzerland, the record premiums of the previous year were<br>not reached again. The main reason was that the pensions of<br>the major customer Swisscanto Collective Foundation<br>previously paid by Helvetia have been borne by the customer<br>itself since 1 January 2014. After foreign markets had<br>suffered in the previous year due to the difficult economic<br>environment, the volume of new business rose again in this<br>area.

          "JNL’s in force result was a loss of £2 million, down from a<br>profit of £277 million in 1999, reflecting a higher than<br>expected level of surrenders of fixed annuities, primarily<br>of older policies.",
          "Actual returns exceeded our expected returns for 2009 which<br>increased our estimates of total gross profits and decreased<br>our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with<br>the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of<br>our variable annuity products, by establishing a new, higher<br>starting point for the variable annuity account values used<br>in estimating those items for future periods. The previously<br>expected rate of return for 2009, for most contract groups,<br>was based upon our maximum future rate of return assumption<br>under the reversion to the mean approach. The increase in<br>our estimate of total gross profits and decrease in our<br>estimate of future expected claims costs results in a lower<br>required rate of amortization and lower required reserve<br>provisions, which are applied to all prior periods. The<br>resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and<br>reserve provisions are recognized in the current period. The<br>$1,060 million charge in 2008 is attributable to a similar<br>but opposite impact on gross profits of market value<br>decreases in the underlying assets associated with our<br>variable annuity products, reflecting financial market<br>conditions during the period.",
          "UK operating profit in 2002 was down at £699 million (2001:<br>£850 million) after a £123 million net charge (2001: £78<br>million) for strengthening annuity reserves. This charge<br>reflected new evidence that suggests improvements in life<br>expectancy are increasing at a faster rate than previously<br>thought.",
          "In contrast, variable annuities – unit-linked life insurance<br>policies with guarantees – were hit the hardest by the<br>problems on the capital markets, falling short of their<br>growth expectations due to the uncertainties on stock<br>exchanges around the world.",
          "In 2011, there was a negative 0.5 per cent rate of return<br>for the variable annuity separate account assets. This<br>compared with an assumed longer-term rate of return of 5.4<br>per cent. Consequently, the asset values and therefore<br>projected future fees at 31 December 2011 were lower than<br>assumed.",
          "The US component primarily includes £156 million reflecting<br>the full charge for bond write-downs and impairments<br>incurred in 2002 to the extent that it is not included in<br>operating profit, a £128 million negative variance against<br>long-term investment returns for equity investments,<br>including private equity holdings, and £145 million<br>primarily in relation to changed expectations of future<br>profitability on variable annuity business in force arising<br>from adverse current year equity returns. This arises due to<br>equity market returns in the year being lower than the<br>assumed long-term rate. This gives rise to lower than<br>expected year-end values of variable annuity assets under<br>management with a resulting effect on the level of future<br>account values and hence future profitability.",
          "*This adjustment arises due to market returns for 2002 and<br>2001 being lower than the assumed long-term rate of return.<br>This gives rise to lower than expected year end values of<br>variable annuity assets under management with a resulting<br>effect on the projected value of future account values, and<br>hence future profitability.",
          "Overall lower than expected returns in 2011 decreased our<br>estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for<br>amortizing DAC and other costs and increased our estimate of<br>future expected claims costs associated with the GMDB and<br>GMIB features of our variable annuity products, by<br>establishing a new, lower starting point for the variable<br>annuity account values used in estimating those items for<br>future periods.",
          "This gives rise to lower than expected year end values of<br>variable annuity assets under management with a resulting<br>effect on the projected value of future account values and<br>hence future profitability from altered fees. For 2008, the<br>US equity market returns were approximately negative 38.5<br>per cent compared to the assumed longer-term rate of return<br>of 5.8 per cent.",
          "As a result of the DoL regulatory initiative and the<br>uncertainties regarding the application and implementation<br>of the Rules, the annuity industry saw material impacts on<br>sales in 2016. Sales in the variable annuity industry as of<br>the third quarter of 2016 at US$79 billion10 were down 22<br>per cent compared with the same period last year.<br>Conversely, sales of fixed index (US$47 billion)10 and fixed<br>annuity (US$45 billion)10 products were higher as of the<br>third quarter of 2016 at 22 per cent and 28 per cent<br>respectively, compared with the same period last year. In<br>recent years, some competitors have begun to offer fixed<br>index annuities with benefits that resemble those of<br>variable annuities, leading to a shift in sales away from<br>variable annuities to fixed index annuities. However, this<br>trend has an uncertain future due to the unexpected<br>inclusion of fixed index annuities within the current rules<br>on par with the treatment of variable annuities.",
          "The decrease was primarily attributable to an unfavourable<br>result from the discontinued variable annuity business of<br>CHF 574 million, primarily due to modified estimated future<br>cash flows, driven by current and expected lapse experience.<br>Our hedging for expected variable annuity cash flows<br>performed within expected parameters.",
          "EUR 40.8 billion. Overall sales of variable annuities,<br>savings products, pensions and asset management all<br>declined, mainly because of unprecedented volatility in the<br>global financial markets.",
          "The turnaround was driven primarily by adverse hedge results<br>on the variable annuities business due to extraordinary<br>market volatility, especially in October.",
          "The end of the bull market in 2001 created a challenging<br>environment in the variable annuity (VA) market. After years<br>of exceptional growth, VA assets were down in 2001, due to<br>lower net inflows and a decrease in equity prices. Net<br>variable annuity cash flow is a key measure of success in<br>this market as it reflects overall variable annuity asset<br>retention and therefore profit potential. JNL ranks eleventh<br>in the industry on this basis with a net inflow of £345<br>million (US$497 million) as at 30 September 2001.",

          "The major reasons for the increase in the claims loss ratio<br>and the level of claims incurred were (a) the continued<br>effect of an underpriced product sold heavily in 1995, (b) a<br>larger number of unexpected and unanticipated prior year<br>claims (1996) paid in 1997, resulting in a 1996 reserve<br>deficiency of approximately $7 million, (c) larger number of<br>annuity policies lapsed than anticipated, (d) a run off in<br>claims due to rate renewal actions and (e) a reserve<br>strengthening in the fourth quarter of 1997.",

          "The RBC Financial Plan identified the following conditions:<br>(a) the PMO product, which was found to be underpriced, was<br>introduced in late 1994 and sold heavily in 1995, (b) the<br>harsh winter of 1995/96, causing numerous accidents and<br>related heart conditions, (c) greater utilization causing an<br>increase in claims processed, (d) state mandates requiring<br>guaranteed issue, (e) state mandated benefits, and (f) the<br>medical trend was higher than expected.",

Losses from the auto<br>dealer program, which was discontinued in 1995, also<br>continued at higher-than-anticipated levels.",

In response to higher than<br>anticipated utilization with respect to certain co-payment<br>products offered to the Company's individual and small group<br>customers in California, the Company has recently<br>implemented premium increases with respect to such products.",

          "Inadequate pricing, and changes in product design and<br>underwriting criteria, undertaken during 1996 contributed to<br>the increase in loss and LAE and resulted in the Company<br>attracting some new insureds with higher loss<br>characteristics than previously experienced.",

The<br>negative variance in France is primarily due to an increase<br>in life annuity pension reserves, resulting from a reduction<br>to the discount rate cap used in the calculation of these<br>reserves.

          "Hannover Re | Annual Report 2017 the poorer-than-expected<br>performance of the US mortality portfolio and the<br>aforementioned one-off effect.",
          "With our subsidiary Hannover Life Reassurance Company of<br>America we have grown into an established and sought-after<br>business partner in our important US mortality market.<br>Business there fell short of our expectations in the year<br>under review. This can be attributed principally to the one-<br>time payout of a very lucrative life insurance policy.",
          "Although expenses for pure mortality covers had returned to<br>normal after the previous year, the operating result was<br>below expectations, predominantly due to a more conservative<br>investment policy designed to stabilise future results.",
          "lines of business Operating income for the Life segment<br>declined 8.2% to USD 381 million for 2013, compared to an<br>income of USD 415 million in 2012. the lower result in 2013<br>was driven primarily by the business recaptured in the first<br>quarter of 2013 and by mortality experience which was less<br>favourable than expected in 2013 as compared to 2012. this<br>was mostly offset by year-on-year favourable experience on<br>variable annuities and the pre-2004 GMDB business, the<br>positive impact from recaptures in europe and the gradually<br>improving but still unfavourable pre-2004 US individual life<br>results.",
          "Parts of the mortality portfolio in the United States<br>performed more poorly than anticipated. This caused the<br>underwriting result in life business for the year under<br>review to decline overall to EUR 29.3 million (EUR 97.0<br>million).",
          "In recent years we have reported regularly on the results of<br>our US mortality business, which have been poorer than<br>anticipated.",
          "With regard to the book of US mortality business assumed in<br>2009, we anticipate further strains in the current year on<br>account of higher-than-expected mortality rates.",
          "We were less satisfied with the development of our US<br>mortality business – and in particular with the portfolio<br>assumed in 2009, which continues to show a mortality in<br>excess of expectations.",
          "Total business The numerous positive developments in our<br>international life and health reinsurance portfolio were<br>accompanied in the financial year just ended by individual<br>parts of the business that fell short of our expectations.<br>Essentially, this involved parts of the US mortality<br>portfolio acquired in 2009.",
          "Reductions in surplus were driven primarily by worse than<br>expected mortality in the universal life business and the<br>impact of PHL Variable’s $36.4 million portion of the COI<br>settlements in the first quarter of 2015.",
          "Despite an otherwise rather good business experience, this<br>was due to losses from our US mortality portfolio, which<br>came in significantly higher than we had anticipated. The<br>primary reasons here were, firstly, that – contrary to the<br>expectations at the time of pricing the business – the<br>mortality improvement in the US population has for some time<br>now failed to materialise to the anticipated extent.<br>Furthermore, the exercise of the various options available<br>to policyholders, particularly in relation to cancellation<br>of their policies, had resulted in a more sharply negative<br>portfolio mix than anticipated, especially in relation to<br>older underwriting years.",
          "It was adversely impacted by reserve strengthening in Israel<br>and increased claims expenditure in Australian disability<br>business, in particular as a result of longer benefit<br>periods. Apart from this, claims expenditure across all<br>other markets was within the expected bounds. This applies<br>in particular to mortality business in the USA, which had<br>been adversely impacted by major losses in the previous<br>year.",
          "The excellent result is largely due to an exceptionally<br>strong investment return and good returns from our life<br>operations. Results from non-life operations were not<br>satisfactory, being influenced mainly by negative results in<br>US medical business – reported in the first half of 1998 and<br>discontinued as an active line of business in the meantime –<br>a general soft market environment, and expenses higher than<br>in the previous year.",

          "In 2002, the Company added approximately $80,948 to its<br>claim reserves for 2001 and prior period incurred claims.<br>During 2002, the Company completed an analysis of the<br>adverse deviation recognized in the past development of its<br>reserves for current claims. The analysis included a<br>comparison of actual to expected experience.",
          "As actual claim emergence became higher than expected, loss<br>and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates were revised<br>upward in 2001 and 2002.",
          "losses was the result of an over 20% increase in an average<br>severity of claims reported in 2001. The 2001 adjustment was<br>also unusually large because Ohio and Florida markets were<br>relatively new for the Company, making our initial reserve<br>estimates very difficult to predict. These higher than<br>expected loss trends continued into 2002, but at a much<br>lower level. As a result, we also added to prior year<br>reserves in 2002, primarily in our Ohio and Florida markets.",
          "In addition, actual loss development during the year<br>continued to exceed our expectations. The average paid<br>closed claim trend had exceeded the average case reserve<br>trend in the recent development. The average outstanding<br>case reserve increased from $54,000 at year-end 2001 to<br>$66,000 at year-end 2002. The average paid claim increased<br>from $18,000 at year-end 2001 to $28,000 at year-end 2002.<br>While the average paid claim was still below the average<br>case reserve, this development in the data caused us to<br>revise our trends and increase our estimate of ultimate<br>losses.",
          "Florida and a late December freeze in the Midwest. Finally,<br>one exceptionally large liability claim added over 8% to the<br>other liability reserves in 2004. The current year<br>development of the prior years’ ultimate liability does not<br>reflect any changes in the Company’s fundamental claims<br>reserving practices.",
          "In the second half of 2001, the Company encountered a large<br>increase in reported losses, primarily in its Florida, Ohio<br>and Kentucky medical professional liability markets. These<br>higher than expected reported loss trends continued into<br>2002, but at a much lower level. As a result, the Company<br>increased prior year loss reserves in 2002, primarily in its<br>Ohio and Florida markets.",
          "Releases of $18.7 million in 2001, $6.2 million in the first<br>quarter of 2002, and $2.1 million in the second quarter of<br>2002 were made to offset the underwriting losses incurred on<br>the under-priced block of business. During the first quarter<br>of 2002 the reserve was reduced by $15 million ($9.8 million<br>net of tax) and during the second quarter of 2002 the<br>reserve was reduced by $4 million ($2.6 million, net of tax)<br>based on an analysis of emerging experience which was more<br>favorable than originally estimated.",
          "During 2002, we concluded that the impact of settling claims<br>in a runoff environment in our Health Care segment was<br>causing abnormal effects on our average paid claims, average<br>outstanding claims, and the amount of average case reserves<br>established for new claims-all of which are traditional<br>statistics used by our actuaries to develop indicated ranges<br>of expected loss. Taking these changing statistics into<br>account, we developed varying interpretations of our data,<br>which implied added uncertainty in our evaluation of these<br>reserves.",
          "The statutory losses incurred during 2002 and 2001 resulted<br>from (1) significant losses on major medical products<br>marketed prior to July 2000 due to higher than expected<br>claim frequency and (2) costs associated with increased new<br>business production which must be expensed under statutory<br>accounting (for GAAP, such costs are deferred and amortized<br>as related premiums are recorded).",
          "During the same period, the consumer confidence index, as<br>measured by the Conference Board, fell from 115.7 to 91.7, a<br>20.7 percent decrease. From 2001 through 2003, the Company<br>experienced an increase in submitted group income protection<br>claims of approximately 6.6 percent. During 2003, claim<br>resolution rates, which partially reflect the Company’s<br>ability to return disabled insureds to work, were lower than<br>in any year since 1999. The combined impact of higher claim<br>incidence and lower than usual claim resolutions contributed<br>to the Company’s reserve strengthening during 2003 for its<br>group income protection reserves.",
          "This increase in reported losses was the result of an over<br>20% increase in the average severity of claims in these<br>markets. The 2001 prior year development of $22.7 million<br>was also unusually large because the Florida and Ohio<br>markets were relatively new to us, making our initial<br>reserve estimates difficult to predict. These higher than<br>expected reported losses continued into 2002, but at a much<br>lower level than in 2001. As a result, we also increased<br>prior year reserves in 2002 by approximately $4.5 million.",

          "Our December 31, 2000 loss reserves contemplated, among<br>other estimates, continued deterioration in claim experience<br>on Medicare+Choice consistent with that experienced earlier<br>in the year. Actual claims paid were less than anticipated.<br>The net medical and other benefits payable assumed from UWS<br>during 2001 developed slightly unfavorably due to the<br>transition of provider contracts from a capitated to fee for<br>service basis.",
          "The decrease of $1.8 million in 2003 and the increase of<br>$12.4 million in 2002, for claims occurring in prior years<br>is well within normal expectations for reserve development<br>and claim settlement uncertainty. The increase of $60.7<br>million in 2001 for claims occurring in prior years is<br>primarily the result of reserve strengthening on the former<br>Meridian Mutual business in order to bring these claim<br>reserves in line with historic State Auto adequacy levels as<br>well as ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends.",

This increase is<br>mostly attributed to the net effect of a decrease in claims<br>costs during 2001 and to non-recurring release of incurred<br>but not reported claims reserve of approximately $1 million<br>during the year 2000. This adjustment is the result of a<br>better than expected actual development of the incurred but<br>not reported claims reserve determined in 1999 for a<br>significant new group that commenced coverage during the<br>last quarter of 1999.",
          "Claims incurred related to prior years for 2000 of $1.55<br>million was primarily attributable to higher than expected<br>medical inflation and utilization.

          "The foregoing indicates that a $12.4 million deficiency in<br>the 2000 reserves emerged in 2001 as a result of higher than<br>expected benefit utilization in the medical segment related<br>to increased costs of services, greater utilization of<br>medical services and greatly increased expenditures on<br>prescription drugs.",

The increase was a result of<br>higher than anticipated benefit utilization in 2001 versus<br>2000 in the medical segment related to increased costs of<br>services, greater utilization of medical services and<br>greatly increased expenditures on prescription drugs, and a<br>larger volume of business in force. Additionally, for these<br>same reasons, a $17.0 million deficiency in 2000 reserves<br>emerged in 2001.",
          "Such ratio was higher in 2000, for the following reasons:<br>(i) our estimate of 1999 year end reserves proved to be less<br>than necessary to cover pre-2000 claims; (ii) the mix of our<br>Medicare supplement business in 2000 included a higher<br>percentage of less profitable standard Medicare supplement<br>policies than the prior year (and a lower percentage of more<br>profitable nonstandard policies that we are no longer able<br>to offer to new policyholders); and (iii) a larger portion<br>of certain older blocks of our Medicare supplement business<br>had remained inforce longer than we expected.",

This $35.7 million increase in<br>the amounts incurred related to prior years was<br>substantially all attributable to our TRICARE operations and<br>resulted primarily from enhanced benefits enacted for<br>TRICARE beneficiaries as a result of Congressional<br>legislation, the impact of which was not fully determinable<br>at December 31, 2001.",
          "The decrease in the medical loss ratio in 2001 is primarily<br>the result of pricing increases and other cost control<br>measures instituted in response to higher than anticipated<br>medical utilization and cost trends. In addition, the higher<br>loss ratio for 2000 also reflects the effect of a premium<br>deficiency reserve of $3.6 million recorded during the<br>second half of 2000 on the Medicare+Choice business.",
          "The foregoing indicates that a $8.4 million deficiency in<br>the 2001 reserves emerged in 2002 as a result of higher-<br>than-anticipated claims cost associated with a reduction in<br>pending claims inventory in the medical segment.",

          "Considering the significant third quarter catastrophe<br>losses, losses sustained in the fourth quarter from<br>California wildfires and other smaller catastrophe losses<br>incurred throughout the year, AIR Worldwide, Risk Management<br>Solutions, Inc., and other industry experts believe that the<br>amount of insured catastrophe losses for 2017 will exceed<br>$100 billion.While many market participants were hopeful<br>that the significant catastrophe losses would lead to<br>significant improvements in pricing, terms and conditions<br>within the property catastrophe line of business with the<br>possibility of improvements in other reinsurance lines, it<br>now appears that the improvements within the property<br>catastrophe line of business at the January 1 renewal date<br>were generally lower than market expectations.",
          "However, the increase in the re-estimated ultimate claims<br>and claim expense ratio for the 2012, 2014 and 2015<br>underwriting years at December 31, 2015 was the result of<br>those underwriting years performing worse than expected, due<br>in part to experiencing claims and claim expenses related to<br>large property losses, including Storm Sandy in 2012, and a<br>number of smaller property-related loss events in 2014 and<br>2015.",
          "A I think the industry has been surprised at the size of the<br>Californian wildfire losses in 2017 and 2018. If these are<br>going to be regular events in the future then the pricing<br>and structure of insurance covering losses such as these<br>will need to change.",
          "• an increase in General Insurance Adjusted pre-tax income<br>due to unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of<br>$1.0 billion in 2017 driven by higher than expected loss<br>emergence in General Insurance primarily related to accident<br>year 2016 compared to $5.4 billion in 2016, partially offset<br>by higher aggregate pre-tax catastrophe losses of $4.2<br>billion, which included losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma<br>and Maria, the earthquake in Mexico and the wildfires in<br>California, compared to catastrophe losses of $1.3 billion<br>in the prior year;",
          "This branch benefited from a significant improvement in<br>pricing conditions (notably +14.5% for non-proportional<br>contracts, of which the portfolio share increased),<br>following a year marked by exceptional losses in 2012. The<br>year opened with the shipwreck of the Costa Concordia, and<br>closed on Hurricane Sandy, which had a considerable impact<br>on the Marine branch.",
          "The loss and settlement expense ratio for 2015 reflects an<br>unusually low amount of reported large losses (losses<br>greater than $100,000) and two large reductions in reported<br>reserves for prior accident year events. A decline in<br>catastrophe and storm losses helped limit the increase in<br>the reinsurance segment's loss and settlement expense ratio.<br>The largest catastrophe and storm loss incurred in 2016 was<br>a $3.5 million loss stemming from the Alberta, Canada<br>wildfire, while the largest loss incurred in 2015 was $4.5<br>million ($4.1 million net of reinsurance recovery under the<br>inter-company reinsurance program with Employers Mutual)<br>from the Tianjin, China explosion.",
          "For the reinsurance market, the wildfires that ravaged<br>California for the second year in a row were far less<br>predictable. Wildfire has historically been regarded as an<br>attritional peril by insurers in California but this<br>approach looks unsustainable after the experience of the<br>past two years. Wildfire losses in 2017 are estimated to<br>have cost insurers $10bn and losses in 2018 look likely to<br>exceed this figure, with current estimates running between<br>$9bn and $15bn.",

For quota share or proportional property and<br>casualty reinsurance contracts, gross premiums written are<br>normally estimated at inception based on information<br>provided by cedants and/or brokers. We believe that the<br>ceding clients’ estimate of the volume of business they<br>expect to cede to us represents the best estimate of gross<br>premium written at the beginning of the contract. As the<br>contract progresses, we continue to monitor actual premium<br>received in conjunction with correspondence from the ceding<br>client and we obtain further client estimates. Gross<br>premiums written also include reinstatement premiums of<br>$10.8 million principally triggered by property catastrophe<br>losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008.",

The high 2002<br>ceded premiums written resulted from the combination of<br>increasing contingent premium cost estimates (including<br>reinstatement premiums) related to prior loss events and<br>higher general retrocession costs. Net premiums written<br>decreased $114 million or 3% in 2001, primarily attributable<br>to (1) higher levels of ceded losses under aggregate excess-<br>of-loss retrocession programs (both current year principally<br>as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 and prior<br>years due to continued adverse claim development) and (2)<br>the decision to exit certain lines of business and customer<br>relationships as part of a reunderwriting initiative<br>undertaken in 2001, somewhat offset by general growth in<br>premiums due to the combination of recent hardening of<br>pricing within the overall property and casualty<br>insurance/reinsurance industry and a focus on growth within<br>certain niche markets.",
          "Surety’s underwriting results in 2002 were also negatively<br>impacted by reinstatement premiums paid for contract surety<br>reinsurance, which reduced our net earned premiums, as well<br>as an increase in losses in our contract surety business<br>where we have experienced a higher than normal level of loss<br>frequency.",

To mitigate<br>our exposure to unexpected losses reported by cedants, our<br>claims personnel review reported losses to ensure they are<br>reasonable and consistent with our expectations.",
